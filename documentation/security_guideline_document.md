Here are the key security focus areas we can tackle. Let me know which one you’d like to start with:

1. **Authentication & Access Control**
   - Supabase Auth (email/OAuth) hardening
   - JWT best practices, session management, expiration
   - RBAC and row-level security policies
   - Multi-factor authentication considerations for future phases

2. **Input Validation & Output Encoding**
   - Sanitize and validate image uploads (/scan endpoint)
   - Secure data flowing into GPT-4o prompts and responses
   - Prevent injection (SQL, NoSQL, command) via prepared statements/ORM
   - Protect against XSS in React Native WebViews and any HTML rendering

3. **Data Protection & Privacy**
   - Encryption at rest (PostgreSQL, Supabase Storage) and in transit (TLS)
   - Secure secrets management (OpenAI key, Stripe secret) via environment or vault
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance: data retention, deletion workflows, user consent
   - PII minimization and masking in logs and error messages

4. **API & Service Security**
   - Enforce rate limiting, throttling, and anti-bot measures on Edge Functions
   - Secure CORS policy for mobile app origins
   - Webhook signature validation for Stripe events
   - API versioning and least-privilege service accounts

5. **Mobile App Security**
   - Secure local storage (avoid sensitive data in AsyncStorage)
   - Certificate pinning and TLS enforcement in React Native
   - Protect against reverse engineering (code obfuscation, tamper detection)
   - Secure push notification flows and opt-in UX

6. **Infrastructure & CI/CD**
   - Harden Supabase and Edge Function configurations
   - Use SCA tools (dependabot, Snyk) for npm packages
   - Secure build pipeline: rotate tokens, restrict actions, signed commits
   - Monitor and alert on anomalous activity (failed logins, unusual API usage)

Once you pick a starting point, I’ll provide detailed guidelines and an implementation plan for that area.
