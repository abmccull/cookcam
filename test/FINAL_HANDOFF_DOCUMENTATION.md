## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Test Suite Failures
1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   node test/test-health-monitor.js check
   
   # Run diagnostic
   ./run-tests.sh integration --verbose
   
   # Check recent changes
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

2. **Escalation Path**
   - Level 1: Review logs and recent changes
   - Level 2: Contact test infrastructure team
   - Level 3: Disable failing tests temporarily
   - Level 4: Rollback recent changes if needed

### CI/CD Pipeline Issues
1. **GitHub Actions Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check workflow status
   gh run list --workflow=test-suite.yml
   
   # View failure details
   gh run view <run-id>
   
   # Re-run failed jobs
   gh run rerun <run-id>
   ```

2. **Coverage Failures**
   - Check Codecov dashboard
   - Review coverage diff in PR
   - Add tests to meet threshold
   - Emergency: Lower threshold temporarily
