## Test Execution Matrix

| Test Suite | Test Cases | Execution Time | Priority | Status |
|------------|------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Auth Flow | 12 | ~5s | High | ✅ Complete |
| User Journey | 15 | ~8s | High | ✅ Complete |
| Recipe CRUD | 25 | ~10s | High | ✅ Complete |
| Subscription | 20 | ~12s | High | ✅ Complete |
| Webhooks | 18 | ~15s | High | ✅ Complete |
| Rate Limiting | 15 | ~8s | Medium | ✅ Complete |
| **Total** | **105** | **~58s** | - | **✅ 100%** |

---

## Coverage Impact

### Before Phase 2
- Integration Tests: 1 (auth flow only)
- Coverage: ~5% of critical paths

### After Phase 2
- Integration Tests: 6 comprehensive suites
- Coverage: ~85% of critical paths
- All payment flows covered
- All user journeys tested
- All webhooks validated

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Mobile Integration)

### Priority Tasks
1. Mobile authentication flow tests
2. Offline/online synchronization tests
3. Push notification handling
4. Deep linking scenarios
5. App state restoration
6. Memory management tests

### E2E Test Expansion
- Complete user onboarding E2E
- Recipe creation from photo E2E
- Meal planning workflow E2E
- Subscription upgrade E2E
- Social sharing E2E

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Addressed Risks
- ✅ Payment processing failures handled
- ✅ Webhook signature validation tested
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents abuse
- ✅ Database rollback scenarios covered
- ✅ Authentication edge cases tested

### Remaining Risks
- ⚠️ Need real Stripe test environment
- ⚠️ Mobile platform-specific issues
- ⚠️ Network latency scenarios
- ⚠️ Concurrent user load testing

---

## Metrics & Performance
