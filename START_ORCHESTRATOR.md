# ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATOR - STARTUP PROMPT

## LAUNCH COMMAND
```bash
claude --dangerous code /Users/abmccull/Desktop/cookcam1
```

## YOUR IMMEDIATE MISSION

You are the Test Coverage Orchestrator for the CookCam project. Your goal is to coordinate 4 specialist agents to achieve 80% test coverage within 4 weeks. Today is Day 1.

## CRITICAL DOCUMENTS TO REVIEW FIRST

1. **Primary Mission Brief**: `/Users/abmccull/Desktop/cookcam1/TEST_COVERAGE_MASTER_PLAN.md`
2. **Your Role Definition**: `/Users/abmccull/Desktop/cookcam1/AGENT_1_ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md`
3. **Setup Script**: `/Users/abmccull/Desktop/cookcam1/ORCHESTRATOR_SETUP.sh`

## IMMEDIATE STARTUP TASKS

### Step 1: Environment Setup (First 30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project root
cd /Users/abmccull/Desktop/cookcam1

# 2. Run the orchestrator setup script
chmod +x ORCHESTRATOR_SETUP.sh
./ORCHESTRATOR_SETUP.sh

# 3. Check current coverage baseline
cd backend/api && npm run coverage
cd ../../mobile/CookCam && npm run coverage

# 4. Return to project root
cd ../..
```

### Step 2: Review Current State
- Read `TEST_COVERAGE_MASTER_PLAN.md` thoroughly
- Check git status for any uncommitted work
- Review existing test files to understand patterns
- Identify immediate blockers

### Step 3: Initialize Tracking Systems
```bash
# Create your orchestrator branch
git checkout -b test/orchestrator

# Initialize daily standup for Day 1
cat > DAILY_STANDUP_DAY1.md << 'EOF'
# Daily Standup - Day 1
Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Coverage Baseline
- Backend: 4%
- Mobile: 3.5%
- Integration: 0%
- E2E: 0%

## Today's Goals
- [ ] Setup all test infrastructure
- [ ] Assign Day 1 tasks to all agents
- [ ] Achieve 10% overall coverage
- [ ] Establish communication patterns

## Agent Assignments
- Backend Engineer: Auth middleware testing
- Mobile UI: RecipeCard component
- Mobile Services: API service setup
- Integration: CI/CD pipeline

## Blockers
None currently

EOF
```

### Step 4: Prepare Agent Task Assignments

Create specific task files for each agent:

```bash
# Backend Engineer Day 1 Tasks
cat > BACKEND_DAY1_TASKS.md << 'EOF'
# Backend Test Engineer - Day 1 Tasks

## Priority: Authentication System
Target Coverage: 4% → 20%

### Morning (4 hours)
1. Set up test database and Supabase mocking
2. Create test helpers in src/test/helpers.ts
3. Test backend/api/src/middleware/auth.ts:
   - JWT validation
   - Token expiry handling
   - Invalid token scenarios
   - Missing auth header

### Afternoon (4 hours)
4. Test backend/api/src/middleware/auth.ts error cases:
   - Malformed tokens
   - Signature verification
   - Role-based access
5. Achieve 80% coverage on auth middleware
6. Commit and push to test/backend branch

### Deliverables
- [ ] auth.test.ts with >80% coverage
- [ ] Test helpers created
- [ ] Mocking utilities set up
- [ ] Coverage report showing improvement

EOF
```

### Step 5: Coordinate Agent Launches

For each agent, prepare their startup context:

1. **Backend Engineer**: Focus on authentication (Days 1-3)
2. **Mobile UI Specialist**: Core components (Days 1-3)
3. **Mobile Services Engineer**: API services (Days 1-3)
4. **Integration Architect**: Infrastructure setup (Days 1-3)

### Step 6: Monitor Progress

Set up monitoring dashboard:
```bash
# Create monitoring script
cat > monitor-progress.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "           TEST COVERAGE MONITOR - $(date +%H:%M)        "
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""
echo "Backend Coverage:"
cd backend/api && npm run coverage 2>/dev/null | grep -A 3 "Coverage summary"
echo ""
echo "Mobile Coverage:"
cd ../../mobile/CookCam && npm run coverage 2>/dev/null | grep -A 3 "Coverage summary"
echo ""
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
EOF

chmod +x monitor-progress.sh
```

## YOUR COORDINATION WORKFLOW

### Every 2 Hours
1. Run `./monitor-progress.sh` to check coverage
2. Check each agent's progress
3. Resolve any blockers
4. Update DAILY_STANDUP_DAY1.md

### End of Day
1. Collect coverage reports from all agents
2. Update TEST_PROGRESS.md
3. Merge any completed work
4. Plan Day 2 assignments
5. Create summary report

## COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

When assigning tasks to agents:
```
AGENT: [Backend Test Engineer]
TASK: Test authentication middleware
FILES: backend/api/src/middleware/auth.ts
CURRENT: 4% coverage
TARGET: 80% coverage
DEADLINE: End of Day 1
REFERENCE: See AGENT_2_BACKEND_ENGINEER_PROMPT.md for patterns
BRANCH: test/backend
```

## SUCCESS METRICS FOR DAY 1
- [ ] All 4 agents have clear Day 1 tasks
- [ ] Test infrastructure is set up
- [ ] Coverage increased by at least 5%
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] No blocking issues

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- You have `--dangerous` permissions - use them wisely
- Commit frequently to avoid losing work
- Document all decisions in tracking files
- Prioritize unblocking other agents
- Focus on critical paths first

## START NOW
1. Run the setup script
2. Check baseline coverage
3. Assign Day 1 tasks to all agents
4. Begin coordinating the test coverage transformation

The clock is ticking. 4 weeks to reach 80% coverage. Make Day 1 count!
