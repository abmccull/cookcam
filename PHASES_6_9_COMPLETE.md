## Verification Results

Ran `./scripts/verify-production-ready.sh`:

**Results**: ✅ Production Ready with Minor Warnings

**Passing Checks**:
- ✅ All critical files present (17/17)
- ✅ CI/CD workflows complete (4/4)
- ✅ Git hooks configured (2/2)
- ✅ Mobile app strict mode enabled
- ✅ Documentation complete (7/7)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Nginx optimizations applied
- ✅ PM2 configuration ready

**Acceptable Warnings**:
- ⚠️ Old migration files use legacy naming (existing files, no action needed)
- ⚠️ Some console.log usage (minor, can be cleaned up post-launch)
- ⚠️ TypeScript compilation warnings (existing code, gradual cleanup)

**Conclusion**: All warnings are acceptable for production launch.
