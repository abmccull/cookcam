# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Issue
The mobile app had TypeScript compilation errors that were initially thought to be Gradle build errors. The errors were coming from incompatible type definitions in node_modules and configuration issues.

## Root Causes
1. **TypeScript check script not using tsconfig.json** - The `check-ts-only.sh` script was manually specifying compiler options instead of using the configuration file
2. **DOM types conflicting with React Native** - The tsconfig included "dom" in lib array
3. **Wrong import paths** - Some files were importing from non-existent modules
4. **Logger API mismatch** - Using `logger.log()` instead of `logger.info()`
5. **Missing type annotations** - Arrays without explicit types

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `check-ts-only.sh`
Changed from:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --jsx react-native src/**/*.tsx src/**/*.ts
```
To:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
This ensures the script uses tsconfig.json settings.

### 2. Updated `tsconfig.json`
- Removed "dom" from lib array (was causing conflicts with React Native types)
- Changed include patterns to be more specific
- Added proper exclude patterns
- Kept `skipLibCheck: true` to ignore node_modules type errors

### 3. Fixed Import Paths
- `../services/supabase` → `../services/supabaseClient`
- `./supabase` → `./supabaseClient`

### 4. Fixed Logger Calls
- `logger.log()` → `logger.info()`

### 5. Added Type Annotations
- `const weeks = []` → `const weeks: React.ReactElement[] = []`
- `let week = []` → `let week: React.ReactElement[] = []`

## Result
✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
✅ Type checking now passes successfully
✅ Configuration properly uses tsconfig.json

## Benefits
1. **Faster builds** - Removed DOM types that weren't needed
2. **Better type safety** - Explicit types for arrays
3. **Consistent configuration** - All tools use tsconfig.json
4. **Cleaner output** - Only shows errors from our code, not node_modules

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to run type checking
2. Update CI/CD to use the same type checking script
3. Keep dependencies updated to avoid type conflicts
4. Use `npm run check-ts` regularly during development
