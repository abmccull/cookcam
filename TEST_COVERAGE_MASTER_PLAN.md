## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers
1. **Flaky Tests**: Implement retry logic, identify root causes
2. **Slow Tests**: Parallelize, optimize database queries, use test doubles
3. **Complex Mocks**: Create shared mock utilities, document patterns
4. **Coverage Gaps**: Focus on critical paths first, add tests incrementally
5. **Merge Conflicts**: Small, frequent commits, clear ownership boundaries

---

## Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (40% coverage)
- Core authentication
- Basic components
- Essential services
- CI/CD setup

### Week 2: Expansion (65% coverage)
- Business logic
