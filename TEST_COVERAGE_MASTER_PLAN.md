## Daily Standup Template

Each agent should report:
1. Yesterday's completed tasks (with coverage %)
2. Today's planned tasks
3. Blockers or dependencies
4. Coverage metric update

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers
1. **Flaky Tests**: Implement retry logic, identify root causes
2. **Slow Tests**: Parallelize, optimize database queries, use test doubles
3. **Complex Mocks**: Create shared mock utilities, document patterns
4. **Coverage Gaps**: Focus on critical paths first, add tests incrementally
5. **Merge Conflicts**: Small, frequent commits, clear ownership boundaries

---

## Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (40% coverage)
- Core authentication
- Basic components
- Essential services
- CI/CD setup

### Week 2: Expansion (65% coverage)
- Business logic
- Complex components
- API integrations
- Integration tests

### Week 3: Completion (80% coverage)
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios

- Optimize performance
- Complete documentation
- Deploy monitoring

---

## Notes

- Prioritize tests that prevent production incidents
- Write tests that serve as documentation
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
- Maintain test independence
- Keep tests simple and readable
