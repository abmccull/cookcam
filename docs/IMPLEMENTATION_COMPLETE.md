## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### Week 1: Foundation (Critical Path)

#### 1. PlanPaywallScreen Implementation ✅
**File**: `/mobile/CookCam/src/screens/PlanPaywallScreen.tsx`  
**Status**: Fully implemented (was empty, now 600+ lines)

**Features**:
- Monthly/yearly billing toggle with dynamic savings display
- Feature lists tailored to Consumer vs Creator plans
- Social proof (3-card layout + testimonial)
- Trial messaging ("Try free for 7 days")
- Primary CTA ("Start Free Trial") with loading states
- "Maybe later" free tier option
- Restore purchases functionality
- Complete compliance text (terms, privacy, cancellation)
- Platform-specific product ID mapping (iOS/Android)
- Accessibility labels and touch targets (44pt+)

#### 2. Demo Flow Routing ✅
**Files Modified**: `WelcomeScreen.tsx`, `App.tsx`

**Changes**:
- "I'm New" button now navigates to `DemoOnboarding` (not old `OnboardingScreen`)
- Added analytics tracking (`onboarding_started`)
- Fixed navigation structure (see "Critical Bug Fixes" below)

#### 3. Funnel Analytics (15+ Events) ✅
**Events Instrumented Across**:
- `WelcomeScreen.tsx`: onboarding_started
- `DemoOnboardingScreen.tsx`: demo_onboarding_viewed, demo_scan_initiated, demo_scan_completed, demo_scan_failed, demo_onboarding_skipped
- `RecipeCarouselScreen.tsx`: recipe_carousel_viewed, recipe_viewed, recipe_selected
- `PlanSelectionSheet.tsx`: plan_selection_viewed, plan_selected, plan_continue_clicked
- `PlanPaywallScreen.tsx`: paywall_viewed, trial_start_initiated, trial_started, trial_start_failed, paywall_dismissed, free_tier_selected, restore_purchases_initiated, restore_purchases_success, restore_purchases_failed

**Properties Tracked**: timestamps, duration, counts, errors, sources, plan types, billing periods

#### 4. Onboarding Persistence ✅
**Implementation**: AsyncStorage flag `onboardingDone`

**Logic**:
- Set to `'true'` after paywall (trial start OR "maybe later")
- Checked on app launch in `RootNavigator`
- Persists across app restarts
- Prevents repeated onboarding for returning users

#### 5. Compliance Text ✅
**Added**:
- Auto-renewal disclosure
- Price after trial messaging
- Cancellation policy ("Cancel anytime in Settings")
- Platform billing notice
- Clickable Terms of Service link
- Clickable Privacy Policy link
- Restore purchases option

**Meets**: App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.2, Google Play Billing policies

### Week 2: Optimization

paywall_messaging: [33/33/34] standard vs urgency vs social_proof
```

**Usage Example**:
```tsx
const variant = useExperiment('value_first_onboarding');
if (variant === 'demo_first') {
  navigation.navigate('DemoOnboarding');
}
```

#### 5. Localization Infrastructure ✅

- Price calculations separated from display
- Numeric values stored independently
- Currency symbols abstracted
- Ready for Intl.NumberFormat integration

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes & Cleanup

### 1. ✅ Navigation Structure Fixed (Critical!)

**Problem Found**: DemoOnboarding and RecipeCarousel were in `AppNavigator`, but accessed during onboarding when users are in `AuthNavigator`. This would cause **navigation failures**!

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved `DemoOnboarding` from AppNavigator → **AuthNavigator**
- Moved `RecipeCarousel` from AppNavigator → **AuthNavigator**
- Removed duplicate registrations of `PlanSelection`, `PlanPaywall`, `AccountGate`

**New Structure**:

**AuthNavigator** (Onboarding & Auth Flow):
```
Welcome → DemoOnboarding → RecipeCarousel → 
PlanSelection → PlanPaywall → AccountGate → 
Login / Signup / CreatorKYC
```

**AppNavigator** (Authenticated App):
```
MainTabs (HomeStack, Camera, Favorites, Leaderboard, Creator, Profile)
ColdOpen
IngredientReview → CookMode
Discover
CreatorOnboarding → CreatorKYC
Preferences (Standard, Enhanced, Notifications)
Subscription
ExampleFeatureGate
```

### 2. ✅ Obsolete Screen Removed

**Deleted**: `/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx` (old 3-slide static onboarding)

**Reason**: Replaced by DemoOnboardingScreen in value-first flow. Was still imported but never used, causing dead code.

### 3. ✅ Type Definitions Cleaned

**Updated**: `RootStackParamList` in App.tsx
- Removed obsolete `Onboarding` type
- Moved `DemoOnboarding` type to auth flow section
- Moved `RecipeCarousel` type to auth flow section
- Documented all changes with comments

### 4. ✅ Import Cleanup

**Removed**: `import OnboardingScreen from './screens/OnboardingScreen';`  
**Added Comment**: `// OnboardingScreen - REMOVED: Replaced by DemoOnboardingScreen in new flow`

## 🚫 What's NOT Implemented (By Design)

The following were listed in the plan but are **deferred to Phase 4** (Testing & Launch):

1. **Production Testing**: Smoke tests, payment sandbox validation
2. **Full Localization**: i18n library integration, translations
3. **Advanced A/B Tests**: Running experiments (framework is ready)
4. **Performance Profiling**: Memory/battery optimization
5. **User Feedback Loop**: In-app surveys, NPS

These require the implementation to be deployed before they can be completed.

## 📝 Notes for Testing

### Test Scenarios:

#### Happy Path:
1. Fresh install → Welcome → Demo scan → Recipes → Plan selection → Paywall → Trial start → MainTabs
2. Verify analytics events fire at each step
3. Verify onboarding flag persists (close/reopen app)

#### Alternative Paths:
1. "Maybe later" → Free tier → MainTabs (with 3 scan limit)
2. Mock demo (if camera denied) → Continue flow
3. "Skip" during demo → Jump to plan selection
4. "Restore purchases" → Existing subscription restored

#### Edge Cases:
1. No camera permission → Primer → Deny → Mock demo offered
2. No internet during recipe generation → Error handling
3. Payment failure → Error message → Retry option
4. Already subscribed → Restore works correctly
