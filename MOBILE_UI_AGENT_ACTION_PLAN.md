   - **Time**: 5 minutes

**Phase 2 Target**: **35% coverage** (35x improvement from baseline)

---

### **PHASE 3: Production Readiness (Final 30 minutes)**
**Target**: 35% â†’ 50%+ coverage for production deployment

#### **Priority 3A: Remaining Components**
8. **OptimizedImage** (50+ test cases)
9. **LoadingAnimation** (50+ test cases)
10. **LevelUpModal** (60+ test cases)

#### **Priority 3B: Navigation & Error Handling**
11. **Navigation flow testing**
12. **Error boundary components**
13. **Accessibility validation**

**Phase 3 Target**: **50%+ coverage** (production-ready)

---

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Proven Success Pattern (From AIChefIcon/ChefBadge)**
```javascript
// 1. Standardized React Native mocks
global.PixelRatio = { roundToNearestPixel: (value) => Math.round(value) };

// 2. Component-specific context mocks  
const mockContext = { /* standardized structure */ };

// 3. Animation mocks that actually work
Animated.Value = jest.fn(() => mockAnimatedValue);

// 4. Proper async test handling
await waitFor(() => { expect(...).toBeTruthy(); });
```

### **Systematic Fix Approach**
1. **Copy Working Patterns**: Use AIChefIcon test structure as template
2. **Standardize Mocks**: Apply same mocking strategy across components
3. **Fix Incrementally**: One component at a time, validate before moving on
4. **Measure Impact**: Check coverage after each component fix

---

## ðŸ“Š COVERAGE PROJECTION

### **Mathematical Coverage Model**
- **Total Statements**: 1,630 across all components
- **Coverage Per Working Component**: ~25 statements average
- **Current Working**: 2 components = 1.04% coverage
- **Target Components**: 20+ components

### **Phase-by-Phase Projections**
| Phase | Components Fixed | Statements Covered | Coverage % | Improvement |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Baseline | 2 | ~17 | 1.04% | - |
| Phase 1 | 6 | ~240 | 15% | 14x |
| Phase 2 | 9 | ~570 | 35% | 35x |
| Phase 3 | 15+ | ~815+ | 50%+ | 50x+ |

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **1. Leverage Proven Patterns**
- **Do**: Copy exact mock structure from AIChefIcon/ChefBadge
- **Don't**: Try new mocking approaches - stick to what works

### **2. Fix One Component at a Time**
- **Do**: Complete one component fully before moving to next
- **Don't**: Try to fix multiple components simultaneously

### **3. Validate Incrementally**
- **Do**: Run tests after each component fix to confirm success
- **Don't**: Batch fixes without validation

### **4. Focus on High-Impact Components**
- **Do**: Prioritize components with most test cases (RecipeCard, MainScreen)
- **Don't**: Get distracted by smaller components

## ðŸ“‹ ORCHESTRATOR MONITORING POINTS

### **15-minute Checkpoints**
- [ ] 15 min: RecipeCard + FilterDrawer fixed?
- [ ] 30 min: Phase 1 complete (15% coverage)?
- [ ] 45 min: MainScreen working?
- [ ] 60 min: Phase 2 complete (35% coverage)?
- [ ] 75 min: Remaining components fixed?
- [ ] 90 min: Production ready (50%+ coverage)?

### **Intervention Triggers**
- **If coverage not increasing**: Stop and reassess mock patterns
- **If tests becoming flaky**: Revert to last working state
- **If timeline slipping**: Reduce scope, focus on highest impact components
